# PythonProject01
Basic Python Project containing  variables, logical operators, conditional statements, lists and while loop

The first part of the program asks the user to input 
- Name
- Surname
- Height
- Age
- Weight

According to some (non verified) data I found online, the program copares

- User Height with Average Men Heigh
- User Weight with Average Men Weight

If the user is overweight, the program suggests how much kg the user need to loos and how many month are necessary to do it so.
